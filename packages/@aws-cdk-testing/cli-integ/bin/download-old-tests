# The old tests package MUST be 'npm install <pkg>'ed as a dependency, but MUST NOT
# end up in a `node_modules` directory.
#
# - MUST be 'npm install'ed: we need transitive dependencies as well.
# - as a dependency: if we check out the source and do an `npm install --production` in the
#   package.json directory, NPM will still try to resolve devDependencies (even though it doesn't
#   need to install them), and the devDeps do not exist on npmjs.
# - MUST NOT end up in `node_modules`: Jest 27 will ignore all tests that have `node_modules` in
#   the path, and this behavior is not configurable before Jest 28. Unfortunately, because of TypeScript
#   typing issues, we cannot move past Jest 27.
#
# To achieve this, do an `npm install <pkg>` then follow up with an `mv` to move the files out.
